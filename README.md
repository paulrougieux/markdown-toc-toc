Markdown Table of content command Copied from https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown .
All other functionalities removed.

This is not needed, I create a table of content with
[Voom](https://github.com/vim-voom/VOoM) instead. With the following in my `.vimrc`:

    let voom_ft_modes = {'markdown': 'pandoc', 'rmd': 'pandoc', 'rnoweb': 'latex'}

Thanks to Jalvesag for the suggestion in [Nvim-R issue 505](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/issues/505)

Kept for historical purposes, just to remember how to extract a bigger plugin into a simple
file type plugin.
